# Sphere-packing density upper bounds

Reproducible certificates for unrestricted sphere packings, organized by dimension on the model of KissingNumbers. These are upper bounds on density, not packing constructions, kissing-number results, or optimality claims. No worldwide-priority claim is made.

## Registered results

| Dimension | Strict density upper bound | Method and proof package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20 | 0.006979502 | [Continuum three-point certificate](verifications/dim20/) |
| 48 | 4.13385739314e-7 | [Cyclic continuum three-point certificate](verifications/dim48/) |

Both use the existing [Cohn–de Laat–Salmon continuum framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15373). Proof notes state the analytic hypotheses and normalization; exact rational witnesses and independent interval verifiers check the computational conditions over full domains. Historical numerical comparisons in package notes are pinned comparisons, not current best-known claims.

## Reproduce

Python 3.11 or newer is required. Install dependencies and run:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python run_all.py

Never disable assertions (`python -O`). No optimization solver or network is needed after dependency installation. The 48D compact triangle replay may take several minutes. Logs record the original audits; fresh replay is recommended. No GitHub Actions workflow is installed.

## Layout

- `verifications/dim20/`: exact witness, proof and two verification paths.
- `verifications/dim48/`: current cyclic witness, complete proof dependencies and independent angular, triangle-domain and radial audits.
- `RESULTS.json`: machine-readable registry.
- `run_all.py`: full certificate replay, failing on any unsuccessful subprocess.

The referenced continuum theorem and standard positive-definite Gegenbauer addition theorem are mathematical inputs, not independently formalized theorems in this repository.
